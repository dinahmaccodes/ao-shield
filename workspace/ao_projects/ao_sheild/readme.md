# AOShield 

**Next-Generation Fraud Protection for Web3**

AOShield is an intelligent security platform that protects cryptocurrency users from fraud, phishing, and malicious transactions in real-time. Built on the AO ecosystem with advanced machine learning, AOShield provides seamless protection while keeping users in complete control.

##  Why AOShield Matters

According to TRM Labs, In 2024 alone, cryptocurrency users lost over **$2.2 billion** to fraud and scams. Traditional security solutions are reactive, outdated within hours, and rely on centralized databases that can be manipulated or compromised.

**AOShield changes everything.**

We've built the world's first **truly intelligent**, **decentralized fraud protection system** that learns from every interaction across the entire Web3 ecosystem, providing protection that gets smarter with every user.

##  What AOShield Does

### **Instant Threat Detection**
The moment you connect your wallet to any website, AOShield's AI analyzes over 200 risk factors in milliseconds, from domain patterns to smart contract behavior.

### **Smart Transaction Monitoring**
Before you send any transaction, AOShield evaluates the recipient, amount, and context against our continuously updated threat intelligence network.

### **Real-Time User Alerts**
When AOShield detects potential fraud, it gives you a clear, 10-second window to make an informed decision with all the risk information you need.

### **Community-Powered Intelligence**
Every blocked fraud attempt strengthens the entire network, creating an immune system for Web3 that evolves faster than scammers can adapt.
