# Solution Overview

An AO-native **Fraud Prevention AI Agent**: a hybrid system where a lightweight Browser Extension acts as the user-facing agent UI, AO-hosted agent processes provide persistent coordination and audit logging, and a cloud-hosted LLM performs heavy inference and explanation. The system blocks or holds suspicious transactions and site connections, alerts users with concise explanations, and permanently records verifiable audit artifacts to Arweave.
