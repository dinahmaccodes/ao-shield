# How can we solve this ?

An AO-native **Fraud Prevention AI Agent**: a hybrid system where a lightweight Browser Extension acts as the user-facing agent UI, AO-hosted agent processes provide persistent coordination and audit logging, and an LLM performs inference and explanation. The system blocks or holds suspicious transactions and site connections, alerts users with concise explanations, and permanently records verifiable audit artifacts to Arweave.
