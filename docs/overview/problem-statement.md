# Problem Statement

- Users interacting with dApps on AO face phishing sites, malicious smart contracts, and accidental wallet drains. 

- EOAs are vulnerable because transactions are signed locally and network broadcasts are irreversible. 

- Users need an autonomous, auditable framework that can detect and block fraudulent site connections and outgoing transactions in real time, while keeping user privacy and providing an auditable evidence trail.
