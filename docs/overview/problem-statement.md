# Problem Statement

Users interacting with dApps on / AO face phishing sites, malicious smart contracts, and accidental wallet drains. EOAs are vulnerable because transactions are signed locally and network broadcasts are irreversible. Users need an autonomous, auditable agent that can detect and block fraudulent site connections and outgoing transactions in real time, while keeping user privacy and providing an auditable evidence trail on Arweave.
